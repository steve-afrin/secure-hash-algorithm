This file is just random textual content to exercise the
calculateChecksum(MessageDigest, File) method in the CalculateChecksum class.

Since calculateChecksum(MessageDigest, File) reads a byte array to build the
message digest, it really doesn't matter if the content of this file is textual
or binary.

Also because of how the message digest checksum is computed, it really makes
little difference how big or small this file is in size. The size of this file
may have a nominal performance degradation for ingestion of the byte array data
in the file to build the actual message digest. It would be reasonable to assume
a 1 GB file would take longer to build the message digest than a 100 KB file.
